#### Starting a `virtualenv`

* Good practice to have a **virtual environment** (an isolated python environment where your library installations are separated from your main system's installations ).
  * Installation of `virtualenv`: `sudo apt-get install python3-venv`
  * Once you make a working directory with your app's code(and you are inside of it)- you can create your `virtualenv`:  `python3 -m venv [NAME OF ENV]`
  * To start the `virtualenv`: `source env/bin/activate`
  * Now you can do all the `pip3`s you want and they will be isolated to this `virtualenv` while its active.
  * Once you are done working in this `virtualenv`: `deactivate`

#### Django Setup:

* To install the library:`pip3 install Django`
* To start project (initialize Django in a directory): `django-admin startproject [NAME OF PROJECT]`  (No dashes should be in the name).
  *  Inside of the `[NAME OF PROJECT DIR]`:
    * `__intit__.py` (Tells Python that this is a Python package)
    * `settings.py` (Project settings can be configured here)
    * `urls.py` (Where we will setup the mapping from certain URLs to where we send the user in our project)
    * `wsgi.py` (WSGI: how our Python app and webserver communicate. Can configure this communication here but default setup is provided.)
  * At the same directory level of this project folder:
    * `manage.py `(Allows us to run command-line commands)
* Start project: `python3 manage.py runserver` ==> Starts a debug website on 127.0.0.1:8000 or localhost:8000
* Within a project you can have multiple apps(e.g store section of the website would be its own "app"). You can also mix and match apps in different projects.
  * Command to create a new app: `python manage.py startapp [NAME OF APP]`
    * There will be a new folder at the same level as the project directory created from `django-admin startproject [NAME OF PROJECT]`.
    * It will have:
      * `__init__.py`
      * `admin.py`
      * `apps.py`
      * `migrations/__init__.py`
      * `models.py`
      * `tests.py`
      * `views.py`
    * You will also notice a `db.sqlite3` at the same level as the django-admin project.

#### Creating a custom page (no templating)

* In the `app/views.py`:

  * You will initially have `render` imported but it is also good to import `HttpResponse`.

  * Create a function in this file: 

    ```python
    def FunctionName(request):
        return HttpResponse("<p>I rather be using Flask.</p>")
    ```

  * Create a file in the app directory `app/urls.py`:

    * There will also be a project level urls.py in the project directory.

    * In the `app/urls.py` have the following (to route to the function above):

      ````python
      from django.urls import path
      from . import views # Current views.py in app/
      
      urlpatterns = [
          path('',views.FunctionName,name="Name") # Keep Name non-generic to lower collision chances
      ]

    * In the project level `urls.py`: 

    ```python
    ...
    # Add include
    from django.urls import path,include
    
    urlpatterns = [
        ...,
        path("Name/",include("app_dir_name.urls")) # Matched url cut from given url and then rest of the url passed in to the app's urls.py
    ]
    
    ```

    * Once we add this paths the debug/default website should stop showing up.
    * If you have `""` in the path(with an include()): then nothing gets matched/cut and the whole thing can get passed in to the app. Good idea to have `/admin` at start if you intend on doing this, so it can still get matched.

  * `python3 manage.py runserver` : should start the dev. server which you can interact it and enter `localhost:8000/Name` to check that the above works.
