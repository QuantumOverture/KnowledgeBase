I will try to share everything I learn here!

DISCLAIMER: I might make mistakes,so please point them out via `Issues`. Also note these markdown documents can be considered "living documents" and might get updated without prior notice :trollface:

### What is this?
This is a repo where I will try to store all my markdown notes that I take when I am learning new,technical topics.

### Future plans?
I want to continue to expand this repo with more notes on different technical topics. Maybe one day I'll have a central website with all this information...
